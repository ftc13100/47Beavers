          <p class="text-center">
            We are FIRST Tech Challenge Team 13100, the 47 Beavers. Our team was
            founded during the 2017-2018 season, in Montgomery County, Maryland.
            The joint-school team consists of students from different high
            schools in Montgomery County, such as Poolesville, Quince Orchard,
            and Northwest. 47 Beavers have won multiple award titles and even a
            semi-finalist during the Maryland State competition.

          <p class="text-center">
            47 Beavers is a team who is dedicated to spreading awareness of the
            STEM field in our community. We want to create more inclusive
            opportunities, for all students from elementary to high school
            levels. As a team, we collaborate with other robotics teams,
            Montgomery County schools, and local businesses to enable
            accessibility and participation in the various areas in STEM.
            <br />
            One of our biggest projects during offseason to give new opportunities
            for younger children (specifically from 3 - 8 graders) would be our BeaverCamps,
            which are our own STEM summer camps with members planning content lessons
            and teach themselves. Check out our <a href="/camps">

          <h2 class="text-center font-bold text-xl">Team Name</h2>
          <p class="text-center">
            Our team name was inspired by a book written by Phil Vischer, 47
            Beavers on the Big, Blue Sea. The book focuses on teamwork and
            collaboration, which are also the core values of our team. We want
            to utilize everyoneâ€™s strengths in order to create the best robotic
            results and to promote an extraordinary learning environment.
